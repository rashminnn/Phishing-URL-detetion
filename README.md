## Overview
Phishing URLs represent a critical cybersecurity threat, targeting individuals and organizations alike. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to classify URLs as either phishing or legitimate. Key components include:
- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful features from URLs for model training.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Compares multiple algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- **Web Application**: Provides a real-time interface for URL analysis, accessible via a deployed web platform or local setup.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from:
- [Mendeley Data - Phishing URL Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/vfszbj9b36/1)

This dataset contains a collection of labeled URLs (phishing and legitimate) used to train and validate the models.

## Model Performance
The project evaluates multiple machine learning models based on accuracy, F1 score, AUC, precision, recall, and training time. The results are summarized below:

| Model               | Accuracy | F1 Score | AUC    | Precision | Recall | Training Time (s) |
|---------------------|----------|----------|--------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Decision Tree       | 0.9207   | 0.8693   | 0.9486 | 0.9048    | 0.8366 | 1.0963            |
| Random Forest       | 0.9357   | 0.8962   | 0.9767 | 0.9130    | 0.8799 | 312.8794          |
| XGBoost             | **0.9301**   | **0.8885**   | **0.9739** | **0.8930**    | **0.8840** | **4.1395**            |
| Logistic Regression | 0.8744   | 0.7692   | 0.8748 | 0.7800    | 0.8000 | 111.7700          |

**Recommended Model**: XGBoost  
- **F1 Score**: 0.8885  
- **Model File**: `phishing_model_xgboost.pkl` (located in the project root directory)

The XGBoost model is selected for its balanced performance across metrics and efficient training time, making it ideal for deployment.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rashminnn/Phishing-URL-detetion.git
   cd Phishing-URL-detetion
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure the `phishing_model_xgboost.pkl` file is in the project root directory.

### Frontend Setup
